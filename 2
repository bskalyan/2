Create a comprehensive Enhanced Business-Intelligent Decision Tree system for fraud detection with the following components in one complete implementation:

CLASS: EnhancedBusinessIntelligentDecisionTree

REQUIREMENTS:
1. MULTI-LAYER CLUSTERING: Implement geographic clustering (region/country/state), temporal clustering (hour/day/weekend patterns), amount-based clustering (transaction ranges), merchant clustering (category/risk), and customer behavior clustering (spending patterns). Use KMeans, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering with automatic cluster optimization.

2. BUSINESS RULE TRANSLATION: Convert technical conditions like "merchant_risk_score > 45.123 AND card_velocity_24h <= 3.0" into business language like "High-risk merchants with low card activity patterns indicate 89% fraud probability". Include confidence levels, sample sizes, business context, and clear if-then logic.

3. SEQUENTIAL PATTERN MINING: Use mlxtend or similar to find transaction sequences leading to fraud (small test â†’ large fraud, rapid successive transactions, velocity patterns). Implement time-based pattern detection and sequence analysis with business interpretations.

4. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING: Implement apriori algorithm to discover feature combinations strongly indicating fraud. Generate rules with confidence, support, lift metrics. Focus on actionable feature combinations with business meaning.

5. ROI-FOCUSED OUTPUT: Calculate potential cost savings, implementation costs, timeline estimates, monthly/annual fraud prevention amounts, false positive reduction metrics, and business impact in dollars for each discovered pattern.

6. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS: Generate specific business actions for each pattern with implementation priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), required resources, timeline, risk mitigation strategies, and monitoring recommendations.

METHODS REQUIRED:
- fit(transaction_data): Train all clustering and pattern mining components
- predict(transaction_data): Generate fraud predictions with business explanations
- generate_business_report(): Create manager-friendly JSON with executive summary, priority rules, cost-benefit analysis, implementation recommendations
- visualize_patterns(): Create business presentation charts

INPUT DATA: Transaction features including transaction_amount, merchant_category_code, is_cross_border, hour_of_day, card_velocity_24h, merchant_risk_score, account_zip, pos_entry_mode, etc.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Manager-friendly JSON with executive summary, priority fraud rules with business descriptions, cost savings estimates, implementation priorities, specific business actions, and ROI analysis.

Include comprehensive docstrings, example usage, error handling, and make output understandable for business managers making fraud prevention decisions. Focus on actionable insights that translate directly to business value and fraud prevention strategies.
